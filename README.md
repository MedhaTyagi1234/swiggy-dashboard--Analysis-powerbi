# Swiggy Dashboard Analysis (Power BI)

This project presents a Power BI dashboard built using Swiggy restaurant data to analyze ratings, offers, cuisine popularity, and veg vs non-veg distribution across locations.

## Objective
To create a clear and honest analytical dashboard that provides an overview of restaurant performance using the available data, without introducing unsupported assumptions or time-based metrics.

## Key Insights
- Overall distribution of restaurant ratings and total offers
- Top restaurants by rating and popularity
- Cuisine popularity across locations
- Pure veg vs non-veg restaurant distribution
- Area-wise comparison of total offers and total ratings

## Tools Used
- Power BI

## Dataset
The dataset contains restaurant-level information including ratings, number of offers, cuisine type, veg/non-veg classification, and location details.

## Notes
- Time-based metrics such as YTD/MTD are not included due to the absence of date fields.
- Revenue-related metrics are intentionally excluded as quantity or order data is not available.
